I and my teammate Anushree Jaiswal collaborated on the creation of the Flappy Bird game as part of the GDSC Web Team. I played the role of mentor, explaining the HTML and CSS components to the participating students.
The project was developed to conduct the `GDSC VIT Bhopal Winterfest`, engaging `over 150 students` from our college.
